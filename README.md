# Course Syllabus: HPC for Simulation Science

## Content and Format

* The content of the course *HPC for Simulation Science* can be found in structured form as a mind-map ([link](...)).
* The format of this course is a flipped classroom. The concept is described on the next.

## Concept: Flipped Classroom
The flipped classroom inverts the traditional learning experience. Lectures are shared outside of class time for individual review as homework, and classroom time is reserved for guided discussions and active-learning formats (including exercises). The principal goals of flipping are as follows:

* To make the classroom an active-learning environment
* To enable students to learn at their own pace, and
* To give the lecturer more time to teach more individually, adapting to the feedback during the plenum event.

During class, **guided discussions and active-learning (Think-Pair-Share and Peer Instruction)** require students to put the lecture materials into practice. In other words, classroom time is used for group work, comprehension tests and in-depth application of the subject matter - with the added benefit of having a lecturer and tutors nearby for problem-solving and collaboration.

This flipped classroom concept provides the following support activities/materials:

* Lecture Videos with Worksheets and frequent Hands-on Exercises
* Plenum (classroom event: guided discussions, active learning)
* Moodle with Forum (Q&A moderated by tutors)
* Consultation Hour (Thursdays at 2 pm)
